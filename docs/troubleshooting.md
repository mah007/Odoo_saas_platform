## 1. Deployment Issues

### Docker Compose Fails to Start

*   **Symptom**: `docker-compose up` fails with an error.
*   **Solution**:
    1.  Check the logs for the failing service: `docker-compose logs <service_name>`
    2.  Ensure all required environment variables are set in your `.env` file.
    3.  Verify that all required ports are available on the host machine.

### Nginx Configuration Errors

*   **Symptom**: Nginx fails to start or returns 500 errors.
*   **Solution**:
    1.  Test the Nginx configuration: `docker-compose exec nginx nginx -t`
    2.  Check the Nginx error logs: `docker-compose logs nginx`
    3.  Ensure your domain names are correctly configured in `nginx/nginx.conf`.

## 2. Application Issues

### 502 Bad Gateway Errors

*   **Symptom**: Nginx returns a 502 Bad Gateway error.
*   **Solution**:
    1.  Check if the upstream service (e.g., `backend`, `frontend`) is running: `docker-compose ps`
    2.  Check the logs for the upstream service for any errors.

### CORS Errors

*   **Symptom**: The frontend fails to communicate with the backend API due to CORS errors.
*   **Solution**:
    1.  Ensure the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable is correctly configured in your `.env` file.
    2.  Verify that your Nginx configuration includes the correct CORS headers.
